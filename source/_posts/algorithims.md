spelliling algorithms correct is important

peaks

- insertion sort always O(N^2) because going through and moving
- binary sort can assist it to be O(log(n)n) for insertions but still N^2 for swaps
- merge sort two arrays, sort, then merge, then split and repeat. O(log(n)n) complexity
- priority queue -
       - maxheap, nodes are always larger than or equal to their children (max heap property)
       - minheap, nodes are always smaller than or equal to their children (min heap property)
- heap sort -- heap on a tree, (breadth first view,)
