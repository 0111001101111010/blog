Day 1
====
This is the start of a small series where I microblog my trip to Europe. I haven't taken a true unplugged break to reflect and slow down. Hopefully this trip will be a way to unwind and unplug and serve as a time of introspection.

Also there will be probably weird musings and cultural (fo) paus commited consistently.

I'm considering an easy way to document my trip.

Musings & Events

* I'm pretty sure I got fleeced at Regan by International Currency Exchange (ICE). My google-fu tells me that exchange rates are 1GBP-1.69 but the traded amount was 1-1.93. There goes a couple dollars
* I read Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks in one sitting, all 18 essays. I need to digest and stew but theres definitely very interesting quotes in section 18 that lend themselves to be quotable. (8/10 good read)
