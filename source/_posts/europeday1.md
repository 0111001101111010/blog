Day 1
====
This is the start of a small series where I microblog my trip to Europe. I haven't taken a true unplugged break to reflect and slow down. Hopefully this trip will be a way to unwind and unplug and serve as a time of introspection.

Also there will be probably weird musings and cultural (fo) paus commited consistently.

I'm considering an easy way to document my trip.
