Day 2
====
Spent an evening in a Yotel. A yotel is a japanese capsule hotel like suite that offs the basic necesities a travel may need. Rent by the hour.

Getting in at 11PM in Heathrow, this seemed like a happy medium between sleeping on the bench or renting a local four star hotel.[Yotel](hwww.yotel.com/hotels/london-heathrow)
